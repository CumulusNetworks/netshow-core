# netshow-core

Netshow is Network Abstraction Software. It is optimized to collect core networking data from devices that contain many network interfaces.

The netshow-core repository contains 2 packages:

### netshow-core-lib:
This is core library for retrieving network information from a  device and abstracting it into Python objects. Its core module is called ``netshowlib``. It contains a few high levels such as ``iface()``, ``system_summary()``, that when called, run a provider check function to retrieve the relevant core information about the interface or system.
A _provider_ is module that interacts with the base system and converts relevant network information into python objects. For example, the _Linux_ provider, when the netshow-core-lib ``iface()`` is called can retrieve network information like MTU, speed, IP address from device running a Linux kernel.

###netshow-core:

Netshow is responsible printing and analysing the information collected from the library component of netshow. *netshow-core* is the core component of this functionality and uses providers (_plugins_) to properly print and analyse gathered by the ``netshowlib`` component of the provider(_plugin_). For example, the ``print_iface`` wrapper class in the Linux netshow provider, is responsible for printing linux network information collected by the Linux provider ``netshowlib`` modules.
